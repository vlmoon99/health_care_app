# 1. Introduction

The main idea of this tutorial is to provide all necessary information about technologies and the way to use these technologies to create apps as fast as possible.

This tutorial will focus on creating a fast prototype with only one problem to solve.

When this problem is solved â€“ you can start to split the code, add new features, and build a solid application.

Our tutorial topic is **Food Analyzer App**.

# 2. Tech Stack

**Backend**: TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL, Supabase Edge Functions)
**Frontend**: Vanilla JS, React, TailwindCSS, Vite, PWA
**AI**: LLM from Google, OpenAI, and other AI providers

# 4. First Step (Domain Models & Use Cases)

Creating Domain Models and Use Cases is the first step before making any application.
It is important because here you define the main entities and logic of the app.
On this step you need to think about your future users, how you will solve their problem, and how they will use the app.

Our Food Analyzer App domain models:

---

* **Attributes** (from Supabase `auth.users`)
* **Relationships**: has many **FoodIntakes**

* Start Screen: Anonymous login with Supabase (simple login button). After pressing login, user is redirected to Home screen.
* Home Screen: Displays a list of FoodIntake cards. Each card shows short details like image (if uploaded), description, and created\_at timestamp.
* Floating Action Button (FAB): Positioned at the bottom center right. When tapped, user can add a new FoodIntake by uploading an image, writing a description, or both. The system processes it and appends the new entry to the list.
* FoodIntake Card Interaction: When a user taps a card, a modal window opens showing full nutrient details. Modal can be scrolled vertically to view all nutrient data (calories, protein, carbs, fats, etc.).
* Bottom Navigation Bar: Contains two tabs:

  1. Home (default) – shows the FoodIntake list with FAB.
  2. Settings – shows a page with one button: "Delete All Data". When pressed, all FoodIntake data for this user is deleted, and the user is logged out and redirected back to the login screen.

Simplified App Flow for LLM :
Login Screen (anonymous Supabase login) → Home Screen (list of FoodIntake + FAB) → FAB pressed (add new FoodIntake) → New FoodIntake displayed as card → Tap on card → Modal opens with nutrient details (scrollable) → Bottom Nav Bar (switch between Home and Settings) → Settings (button to delete all data and return to login).
